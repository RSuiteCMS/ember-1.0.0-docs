# ember-1.0.0-docs

Ember documentation for Ember 1.0.0 (used in RSuite 4.x series)

This archive is the result of a clone of the [Ember website](https://github.com/emberjs/website/) at commit 
[c5b75ff](https://github.com/emberjs/website/tree/c5b75ff4304cc19f8e6201d29aebea86a386750f).  The site was 
built and run, and made static by scraping the minuteman site via scriptlet (see: rip.js), run on a local
browser open to http://localhost:4567/api.  The resulting zip file was unpacked to this repository.
